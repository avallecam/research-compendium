## Questions to think about

- How many times have we wanted to revisit a statistical analysis months or years later and have not been able to, either because we do not remember how to do it or the data is not easily available? 

- How much time do we waste redoing statistical analyses, figures or tables after correcting an error in the data or following a reviewer's recommendations? 

- How much time do we spend trying to implement a new analysis method based on the brief description provided in an article? 

- How many times have we tried to collect data but failed because the authors have lost the data, its format is unreadable today, or they refuse to share it?

## Why improve our code for epidemic analysis?

When we want to improve our analysis code's reliability and reusability, we want to make it reproducible.

Reproducible research aims to ensure that _anyone_ with access to data inputs and software can _feasibly generate_ the data outputs, both to check or _build on them_. Reproducibility is improved when mixed with Open science and Sustainable software features.

Our vision for this workshop is to increase the awareness of good practices that will increase the reproducibility of data analysis workflow that already uses R and Git.

## What can we do?

A fair strategy to follow is to gradually incorporate good practices in scientific computing ([Wilson et al. 2017](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)) that include: 

- Data management, 
- Software development, 
- Collaboration, 
- Project organization, 
- Keep track of changes, and 
- Manuscript writing.

## How can we start?

Our plan for this workshop is to prioritize three tools, given their usefulness once mastered and the time to master them:

- Use research compendium templates.
- Make reproducible analysis.
- Write informative READMEs.

We'll relate relevant features for Sustainable software, Reproducible research, and Open science for each tool.

### Do I need to use them all from today?

No, we do not intend you start adopting all these workshop's good practices and tools.

If you already use a programming language like R and Git for version control, [you are already on the path!](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160/figures/1)

We support the opinion of [Jaime Quinn](https://sorse.github.io/blog/a-reproducible-phd/): "It can be challenging to absorb so many different good practices while still getting research done. However, I would argue that _anything helps_. While all good practices in open science are important, even just incorporating one example is good for the community and provides a solid personal foundation for _gradually incorporating_ more good practices."

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Our vision is to increase the awareness of tools to improve the reproducibility of data analysis.
- Our strategy is to incorporate good practices in scientific computing gradually.
- We plan to share specific tools to create a research compendium, make a reproducible analysis, and write READMEs.
