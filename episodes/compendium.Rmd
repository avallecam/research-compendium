:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How do you create a research compendium for an R project?
- How do I facilitate users and collaborators to participate in my project?
- What features are related to sustainable software?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Adapt a research compendium template with files and folders organized logically with `{rcompendium}`.
- Add community files for users to seek support and contribute with `{usethis}`
- Identify your project features related to sustainable software.

## What is a research compendium?

A research compendium collects all digital parts of a research project, including data, code, and texts (protocols, reports, questionnaires, metadata). We create this collection in such a way that reproducing all results is straightforward ([The Turing Way Community, 2022](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/compendia#summary))

Using templates facilitates having all the required files from the beginning of your project.

We understand that creativity can be “messy” sometimes. You will be able to handle it in the present, but your collaborators (and the future you) may have problems understanding it. Reproducibility is as much about the humans that interact with the code as the machines that need to run it ([Campitelli and Corrales, 2022](https://eliocamp.github.io/reproducibility-with-r/materials/day1/02-projects/)).

## Let's code

### Create a Rstudio Project

Go to `Project`, which is in the top right corner of Rstudio and select `New Project...`. Follow these steps:

- Select `New directory`, 
- Select `New project`, and 
- Check the `[x] Create a git repository` option

:::callout

#### Stop! Find a name!

Don't use `projectname` as your R project name!

Create a new one, thinking about your current research project.

:::

Your `projectname` must follow some rules for everything to work. It must:

- contain only ASCII letters, numbers, and `.` (it can not have a `-`)
- have at least two characters
- start with a letter (not a number)
- not end with `.`

### Create a research compendium

To create a new research compendium run:

```r
rcompendium::new_compendium()
```

This function will create new files and folders as a template. You can rearrange the folder elements by size to identify its components.

![](fig/projectname-01.png)

We will explore the content of each new element during the workshop.

This function will also create the GitHub repository for your project. This step will open a new tab in your browser.

### Add community files

We are going to add more files to the default template. For this, we are going to use a package with helper functions called [`{usethis}`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/).

To add community files, run:

```r
usethis::use_tidy_github()
```

This function is a convenience [wrapper function](https://stackoverflow.com/q/44783295/6702544) that adds four template files in a new folder called `.github/`: 

- `SUPPORT.md` with resources to seek support.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with contributing guidelines.
- `issue_template.md` with steps on how to report issues.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` with guidelines to foster an environment of inclusiveness and to explicitly discourage inappropriate behaviour.

These four files follow the tidyverse standards. You can edit them [writing with `Markdown`](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/rmarkdown.html#write-with-markdown) to fit your specific project content purposes.

:::prereq

Now `commit` and `push` your changes using `git`.

#### Git reminders

- We use [`git commit`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-commit) to capture a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. We use `git add` to 'stage' changes that we will store in a commit.

- We use [`git push`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-push) to upload `local` repository content to a `remote` repository.

![Source: https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/git-remote](fig/push-and-pull.png)

- You can use [Git with Rstudio](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2020/04/23/10-commands-to-get-started-with-git/) to performs these tasks.

#### Git with Rstudio reminder

- From the “Review changes” pane:
    + Go to the “History” tab in the top left.
    + Show that each commit has an ID under the [SHA/hash](https://happygitwithr.com/repeated-amend.html?q=sha#um-what-if-i-did-push) column

- Go to GitHub:
    + Identify where this ID, called SHA/hash, is located.

### Where are community files visible?

GitHub automatically recognizes these files and adds them as hyperlinks in specific places. 

1. Go to the __About__ section in the upper right corner side of your repository, to read the `Code of conduct`:

![](fig/code_of_conduct.png)

2. Go to the __Issues__ tab on the navigation bar at the top of your repository on GitHub. You will find a link to the `issue templates` you added there.

![](fig/issue_template.png)

3. Press the `"Get started"` button on the right to write on top of the template. In the lower right corner, the __Contributing__ and __Support__ files are accessible under the _Helpful resources_ subtitle.

![](fig/helpful_resources.png)

These community files are also known as [community health files](https://github.blog/changelog/2019-02-21-organization-wide-community-health-files/)

:::discussion

- Do you find the links to the Community files visible enough on GitHub?

- Have you ever found them in a different place in the past?

## Sustainable software features

Software is sustainable when it's easier to __maintain__ and __extend__ rather than __replace__. This _easiness_ depends on the: 

- _Quality_ of the software, 
- _Skills_ of the potential maintainers, and 
- _How much_ the user community is willing to invest to keep the software up to date.

Features like a __Compendium template__ and __Version control__ increase the quality of the software. 

- A _compendium_ follows a logical and familiar structure. 
- A _version control_ software registers the project's history and how one or multiple contributors wrote code and made decisions. 

Additionally, __Community files__ consider any gaps in the community of users to facilitate their participation and how to interact with maintainers.

:::testimonial

_Is a data analysis also considered a piece of software?_ 

Nick Huber, from the blog Towards Data Science, concludes that [data analysis best practices/tools are starting to strongly resemble practices/tools from software engineering](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-analysis-is-a-form-of-software-engineering-876232bd3ebc)

The repository of this lesson also came from a template that looks like a derivative of a research compendium, which also looks like a piece of software like an R package.

:::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `{rcompendium}` templates to reuse all the files and folders a research project needs. 
- Use `{usethis}` to add complementary community files to a research project.
- Version control, Research compendium, and community files are features related to Sustainable software.
